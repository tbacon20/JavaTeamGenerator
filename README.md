## Random Team Generator
## Team members: Tanner Bacon, Ben Kloepfer, Parker Schmidt, Jenna Connell, Jialing Lu

This project randomly assigns classmates to a team for team projects.

This can be altered to create teams based on a required number of teammates or a required number of teams.
There are many ways to randomize the teams, but we decided to use the same principle as shuffling a deck of cards and then distributing them to players one by one.
